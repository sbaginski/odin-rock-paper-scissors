# Odin Rock Paper Scissors

A basic Rock, paper, scissors game written in Javascript that utilises the basic
programming language concepts such as I/O, conditionals, functions, variables, and loops.
The communication with the user is done through the console and pop-up windows,
which prompt user to type their choice (meaning no GUI).
